Whac-A-Mole (Game)
=======================
Nice time pass and good tool to test your reflex time
uses arduino 5 Led and 5 buttons one 16x2 LCD

Original code was developed by someone else and modified by me to add some more features like reset at end of game, Reflex time display etc
i will add some more feature and fine tune the codes (i know there are a lots of variable used for no reason) when i get time

Write your name on line 6, save it, and then head back to GitHub Desktop.
may be realese a more complex once with more buttons and an i2c display

Library used are
LiquidCrystal.h
stream.h
avr/wdt.h

Thanks to the developers of the library.

Attached is the Proteus file for circuit Diagram and simulation
